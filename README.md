# HLA_typer
This is a reworking of the current excel/.net based HLA utility used by the techs at the HLA lab.  The one in use has some dependencies that are proving to be 
problematic.  Microsoft changes how excel does tasks, and breaks the utility.  The code is hard to maintain, and this should make it more concise, and hopefully 
less dependent on dependencies that will change.

There is no plan to have this connect to the internet.  It will be a stand-alone utility installed on the ~7 techs desktops.  

More requirements and to-do list forthcoming.
